Fibmap is an automated tool for calculating and displaying the intermolecular forces (Salt Bridges, Hydrogen Bonds, and Pi Stacking interactions) within a finite amyloid fibril model from a PDB file or Molecular Dynamics trajectory.  

Developed by Conor B. Abraham in the Straub Group at Boston University, Department of Chemistry

## Disclaimer

FibMap is still a work in progress. If you run into any issues please report them [here](https://github.com/conor-b-abraham/FibMap/issues).

## Background and Motivation

Naturally formed amyloid fibrils can be categorized into two groups: (1) Functional amyloid fibrils, such as the premelanosome protein 17 (Pmel17) fibril that enables melanin synthesis, serve many vital biological roles [[1,2]](#references). (2) Pathogenic amyloid fibrils, such as the β-Amyloid (Aβ) fibril of Alzheimer’s Disease and the Serum Amyloid A (SAA) fibril of Systemic AA Amyloidosis, are effective disease-causing agents [[2]](#references). Amyloid fibrils are defined by their elongated and unbranched amyloid scaffold that is composed of cross-β sheet stacked monomers that are parallel (N-terminus to N-terminus and C-terminus to C-terminus) and in-register (residues are aligned with matching residues in adjacent layers) [[2,3]](#references). They can contain one or more parallel stacks of monomers, called protofilaments. The residues that are not a part of the amyloid scaffold make up intrinsically disordered regions at the exterior of the fibril. Despite all containing the amyloid scaffold, a broad variety of amyloid fibril structures have been identified, and individual amyloid proteins can form multiple polymorphs. Such polymorphism has been detected for many pathogenic amyloids [[4–10]](#references).

FibMap.py was created to aid the analysis of the evergrowing collection of amyloid fibrils available on the [RCSB PDB Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/) and to understand commonalities and differences among amyloid fibril polymorphs.

## Methodology

### Hydrogen Bonds
FibMap uses MDAnalysis's Hydrogen Bond Analysis tool for calculating hydrogen bonds. Please see the [MDAnalysis Documentation](https://docs.mdanalysis.org/stable/documentation_pages/analysis/hydrogenbonds.html) for more information.

Potential hydrogen bond acceptors and hydrogens are guessed using the atom charge information. An atom whose charge is less than -0.5e is considered a potential acceptor. Atoms with a mass greater than 0.9u and less than 1.1u and a charge greater than 0.3e are considered potential hydrogen bonded hydrogens. Potential hydrogen bond donors are inferred from the list of potential hydrogen bonded hydrogens.

</div>
<div class="caption">
    Figure 2: Schematic showing $$\theta_{D-H-A}$$ and $$D_{D-A}$$ of a hydrogen bond. For a given set of a potential hydrogen bond donor and hydrogen and a potential hydrogen bond acceptor, $$\theta_{D-H-A}$$ and $$D_{D-A}$$ must be below their cutoff.
</div>

Hydrogen bonds are identified from sets of potential hydrogen bonds donors, acceptors, and hydrogens using a donor-acceptor distance cutoff ($$D_{D-A}$$, Default: 3.5Å) and a donor-hydrogen-acceptor angle cutoff ($$\theta_{D-H-A}$$, Default: 150°) as shown in Figure 2. These cutoffs can be changed from the commandline or with an input file if desired (See [Usage: calc: Parameters](#parameters)).

### Salt Bridges
FibMap calculates salt bridges by identifying charged residues and calculating the minimum distance between the charged regions on their sidechains. If the minimum distance between a cation and an anion is below the distance cutoff (Default: 4Å) it is counted as a salt bridge (Figure 3). The distance cutoff for a salt bridge can be changed from the commandline or with an input file if desired (See [Usage: calc: Parameters](#parameters)).

Determination of charged residues capable of forming salt bridges can be done manually or automatically. The salt bridge group determination method and its associated parameters can be set from the commandline or with an input file (See [Usage: calc: Parameters](#parameters)). If done manually, the user can select the residue names and atom names they want to include in the calculation. The default names for manual determination are based on the CHARMM36 force field atom and residue names and are set to include aspartic acid and glutamic acid as anions and lysine, arginine, and basic histidine as cations (Table 1).

| Type | Residue | Residue Name(s) | Atom Names |
|---|---|---|---|
| Anion | Aspartic Acid | ASP | OD1, OD2 |
| Anion | Glutamic Acid | GLU | OE1, OE2 |
| Cation | Lysine | LYS | NZ |
| Cation | Arginine | ARG | NH1, NH2, NE |
| Cation | Basic Histidine | HSP | ND1, NE2 |

<div class="caption">
    Figure 3: Schematic showing the automatic salt bridge group determination method and distances. For lysine (left), the overall charge of the NH<sub>3</sub> group is 0.69e. Because this is the largest charge on the lysine sidechain, the NZ atom will be used as a reference point. For aspartic acid (right) the OD1 and OD2 atoms each carry a -0.76e charge. Assuming this is below the anion charge cutoff, both atoms will be used as reference points. As aspartic acid has 2 reference points and lysine has 1 reference point, two distances are computed, $$D_{NZ-OD1}$$ and $$D_{NZ-OD2}$$. At least one of these distances must be below the salt bridge distance cutoff for it to count as a salt bridge.
</div>

If done automatically, charged residues are identified using the atom charges in the topology. Then, for each heavy atom in a charged residue, the total charge of that atom and any connected hydrogens is computed (Figure 3). For anions, if the total charge is less than the charge cutoff (Default: -0.5e), the heavy atom is added to the charged region for that atom. For cations, if the total charge is greater than the charge cutoff (Default: 0.5e), the heavy atom is added to the charged region for that atom. If no heavy atom meets the cutoff requirement for an acidic or basic residue, the heavy atom closest to the cutoff will be used and a warning will be thrown.

### Pi Stacking Interactions

</div>
<div class="caption">
    Figure 4: Various measures used in finding and categorizing pi stacking interactions. Based on Fig. 2 from Zhao et al. (2015) [[13]](#references).
</div>

To calculate pi-stacking interactions, FibMap follows the methodology developed by Zhao et al. [[13]](#references). For the ring of each phenylalanine, tyrosine, histidine, and tryptophan residue, we define its normal vector ($$\mathbf{n_i}$$), ring plane vector ($$\mathbf{r_i}$$), and centroid (Figure 4). Then, for each pair of rings, we calculate their centroid-centroid distance ($$\mathrm{R_{cen}}$$), the acute angle between the centroid-centroid vector and $$\mathbf{r_1}$$ ($$\theta$$), the acute angle between the centroid-centroid vector and $$\mathbf{r_2}$$, and the acute angle between $$\mathbf{n_1}$$ and $$\mathbf{n_2}$$ (Figure 4).

Any pair with $$\mathrm{R_{cen}} \leq 7.2$$ Å could be a pi stacking interaction, so we define its type (Figure 5). If $$\theta \lt 30^{\circ}$$ and $$\delta \lt 30^{\circ}$$, its a spurious interaction (not a pi stacking interaction). If $$\gamma \lt 50^{\circ}$$, it's a T-shaped pi stacking interaction. If $$30^{\circ} \leq \gamma \leq 50^{\circ}$$, it's an intermediate pi stacking interaction. If $$\gamma \lt 30^{\circ}$$ and either $$\theta \gt 80^{\circ}$$ or $$\delta \gt 80^{\circ}$$, its a sandwich pi stacking interaction. If $$\gamma \lt 30^{\circ}$$ and neither $$\theta \gt 80^{\circ}$$ nor $$\delta \gt 80^{\circ}$$, its a parallel displaced pi stacking interaction.

</div>

At this time, the calculation of pi stacking interactions depends upon residue and atom names. In the future, I would like to completely remove naming dependence from the program, but for now this is the only part of the program that still relies on it. By default, the program uses the CHARMM36 forcefield residue and atom names (Table 2). These names can be changed from the commandline or using an input file (See [Usage: calc: Parameters](#parameters)).

| Residue | Residue Name(s) | Atom Names |
|---|---|---|
| Phenylalanine | PHE | CG, CD2, CE2, CZ, CE1, CD1 |
| Tyrosine | TYR | CG, CD2, CE2, CZ, CE1, CD1 |
| Histidine | HSD, HSE, HSP | CG, CD2, NE2, CE1, ND1 |
| Tryptophan | TRP | CG CD1, NE1, CE2, CD2 |

> Table 2: The default residue and atom names used to select the aromatic rings that could participate in a pi stacking interaction. *NOTE: Notice that the 5-membered ring (not the 6-membered ring) is used for Tryptophan. This follows the guidance of Zhao et al (2015) [[13]](#references).*

### Probabilities

The goal with calculating the probabilities (or average number of) a given type of interaction within the fibril is to have the probability reflect that of an infinite fibril. 

> *NOTE: For pi stacking interactions, the processed results file will contain values for* $${P(Sandwich)}$$*,* $$P(T-Shaped)$$*,* $$P(Intermediate)$$*, and* $$P(Parallel \text{ } Displaced)$$*, as well as,* $$P(Total)$$*.* $$P(Sandwich)$$*,* $$P(T-Shaped)$$*,* $$P(Intermediate)$$*, and* $$P(Parallel \text{ } Displaced)$$ *are computed after* $$P(Total)$$ *(i.e. they tell you the probability that the pi stacking interaction is of that kind IF it exists). The probability cutoff for displaying a pi stacking interaction on the FibMap is only applied to* $$P(Total)$$*.*

#### Interlayer Interactions
For interlayer interactions, this means that the probabilties need to be adjusted to reflect the fact that in a finite fibril model (such as the Cryo-EM structures deposited on the PDB databank), the terminal layers of the fibril are unable to form the interaction. We also have to consider that in our FibMap representation, sidechains are represented by a single point, so for some sites and types of interactions multiple interactions may occur (e.g. Arginine sidechains can form multiple hydrogen bonds). Finally, because the layers of some fibrils are 'staggered', interlayer interactions involving a given layer could occur between that layer and multiple other layers. For example, consider two sites, A and B, on a 4 layer fibril (Figure 6).

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">

</div>
<div class="caption">
    Figure 6: Two interaction sites on a four layer fibril forming $$\Delta \ell=1$$ and $\Delta \ell=2$ interactions.
</div>

On the FibMap, we will be representing two different interactions with the same representation, an $$A_{i}\text{ }to\text{ }B_{i+1}$$ interaction and an $$A_{i}\text{ }to\text{ }B_{i+2}$$ interaction. When calculating this probability we have to account for the fact that a maximum of 3 $$A_{i}\text{ }to\text{ }B_{i+1}$$ interactions can occur and a maximum of 2 $$A_{i}\text{ }to\text{ }B_{i+2}$$ interactions can occur. We also have to account for the fact that in the case that a single interaction does not occur, it does not necessarily change the overall probability of an $$A_{i}\text{ }to\text{ }B_{j \neq i}$$ interaction (e.g. if $$A_{4}\text{ }to\text{ }B_{3}$$ does not occur, but the probability of an $$A_{i}\text{ }to\text{ }B_{i+2}$$ is 1, then the overall probability of an $$A_{i}\text{ }to\text{ }B_{j \neq i}$$ interaction is still 1). So, the overall probability of an $$A_{i}\text{ }to\text{ }B_{j \neq i}$$ interaction at a given timestep, $$f$$, is given by:

$$p_{A_{i} \text{ } to \text{ } B_{j \neq i}}(f) = \mathrm{max} \left\lbrace p_{A_{i} \text{ } to \text{ } B_{i+1}}(f), \text{ } p_{A_{i} \text{ } to \text{ } B_{i+2}}(f), \text{ } p_{A_{i} \text{ } to \text{ } B_{i+1, i+2}}(f) \right\rbrace,$$

where $$p_{A_{i} \text{ } to \text{ } B_{i+1}}(f)$$ is the probability that eligible sites are bound by an $$A_{i} \text{ } to \text{ } B_{i+1}$$ interaction, $$p_{A_{i} \text{ } to \text{ } B_{i+2}}(f)$$ is the probability that eligible sites are bound by an $$A_{i} \text{ } to \text{ } B_{i+2}$$ interaction, and $$p_{A_{i} \text{ } to \text{ } B_{i+1, i+2}}(f)$$ is the probability that elibile sites are bound by either an $$A_{i} \text{ } to \text{ } B_{i+1}$$ interaction or an $$A_{i} \text{ } to \text{ } B_{i+2}$$ interaction. We compute these subprobabilities by considering the number of sites involved in each interaction rather than by considering the number of interactions themselves, allowing us to extrapolate to an infinite fibril. These subprobabilities are given by:

$$p_{A_i \text{ } to \text{ } B_{i + \Delta \ell}}(f) = \frac{n_{s,bound}}{n_{s,eligible}},$$

where $$n_{s,eligible}=2(n_{layers}-\Delta \ell)$$ is the number of eligible interaction sites given the fibril model (e.g. for the above example, $$n_{s,eligible}=6$ for $p_{A_{i} \text{ } to \text{ } B_{i+1}}(f)$$, $$n_{s,eligible}=4$$ for $$p_{A_{i} \text{ } to \text{ } B_{i+2}}(f)$$, and $$n_{s,eligible}=6$$ for $$p_{A_{i} \text{ } to \text{ } B_{i+1,i+2}}(f)$$). Here, $$\Delta \ell$$ is the number of layers spanned by a given subtype (e.g. $$\Delta \ell (A_{i} \text{ } to \text{ } B_{i+1}) = 1$$ and $$\Delta \ell (A_{i} \text{ } to \text{ } B_{i+2}) = 2$$), or the minimum $$\Delta \ell$$ for the combined subprobability (e.g. $$\Delta \ell (A_{i} \text{ } to \text{ } B_{i+1, i+2}) = 1$$), and $$n_{layers}$$ is the total number of layers in the fibril. $$n_{s, bound}$$ is the number of those sites involved in a given interaction (or in either interaction for the combined subprobability). We then take the ensemble average of the overall probability at each frame for each interaction: 

$$P(A_i \text{ } to \text{ } B_{j\neq i})=\frac{1}{n_{f}}\sum_f^{n_f} p_{A_{i} \text{ } to \text{ } B_{j \neq i}}(f).$$

For Hydrogen Bonds, since more than one may form between a pair of sites, you also have the option to use a average number of interactions, $$\langle N_{HB} \rangle$$ cutoff for the FibMap. For an individual frame, the average number of interactions for a given pair of interaction sites is given by:

$$N_{A_i \text{ } to \text{ } B_{j\neq i}}(f) = \frac{2(n_{interactions})}{n_{s, weighted}},$$

where, 

$$n_{s,weighted} = \sum_{\Delta \ell}^{n_{\Delta \ell}}(2(n_{layers}-\Delta \ell)/n_{\Delta \ell}),$$ 

and $$n_{\Delta \ell}$$ is the number of subtypes for this type of interaction (e.g. $$n_{\Delta \ell}=2$$ for our above example).

Finally, we take the ensemble average of the overall average number of interactions for each frame:

$$\langle N(A_i \text{ } to \text{ } B_{j\neq i}) \rangle=\frac{1}{n_{f}}\sum_f^{n_f} N_{A_{i} \text{ } to \text{ } B_{j \neq i}}(f).$$

#### Intralayer Interactions

For intralayer interactions, such complexity is not needed. At each frame, the probability is computed by taking the number of interacting sites and dividing it by the number of total sites:

$$p_{A_i \text{ } to \text{ } B_i}(f) = \frac{n_{s,bound}}{n_{s}},$$

where $$n_s=2n_{layers}$$ is the total number of sites. Similarly, the number of interactions per site is given by:

$$N_{A_i \text{ } to \text{ } B_i}(f) = \frac{2(n_{interactions})}{n_{s}}.$$

Then, $$P(A_i \text{ } to \text{ } B_i)$$ and $$\langle N(A_i \text{ } to \text{ } B_i) \rangle$$ are then computed in the same manner as for interlayer interactions.

### Residue Positions

To determine the positions of the residues on the FibMap the positions of a central fibril layer are rotated such that the vector defined by its longest interatomic distance is aligned with the X-Axis. The purpose of this is twofold: (1) It will orient the layer so that it is closely aligned to the XY-plane, and (2) It will orient the positions so that the FibMap is wider than it is tall (i.e. landscape orientation). All layers of the fibril at all timesteps are then RMSD-fit to this layer using the Kabsch algorithm. The mean XY-position of each alpha-carbon, sidechain center-of-mass, or terminal atom center-of-mass is then taken for each position. 

> *NOTE: In the future, I may play around with various projections, but for now I figure that it's best to keep it simple.*
>
> *NOTE: In the future, I will add an option for a portrait orientation.*

### Trajectory Analysis

For the trajectory analysis (completed by the `FibMap.py traj` subcommand), the number of interactions of a given type per layer is computed for each frame. For a finite fibril model with $n_{layers}$, an interlayer interaction with a layer separation of $\Delta \ell$ can only occur $n_{layers} - \Delta \ell$ times, so for a given frame the number of interactions per layer for a given type of interaction is computed as:

$$N(f) = \sum_{i} \frac{1}{n_{layers}-\Delta \ell(i)},$$

where $$\Delta \ell$$ us the layer separation between the two sites (i.e. for interaction $$i$$ between site $$A$$ in layer $$\ell_A$$ and site $$B$$ in layer $$\ell_B$$, $$\Delta \ell(i))=|\ell_A - \ell_B |$$.

### Dependencies
FibMap was developed for Python 3 using the following libraries:

[![MDAnalysis][mda-badge]][mda-url]

[![Scipy][scipy-badge]][scipy-url]

[![Numpy][numpy-badge]][numpy-url]

[![MatPlotLib][mpl-badge]][mpl-url]

## Usage

The functionality of this program is broken up into three subcommands, `calc`, `map`, and `traj`. Use `calc` to compute interactions within the fibril structure. Then, use `map` to create the visualization and/or `traj` to perform the trajectory analysis.

### calc

The `calc` subcommand is used to compute the intermolecular forces within the fibril. This must be completed before running the `map` subcommand or the `traj` subcommand. Run this subcommand with `python FibMap.py calc ...`. For additional help with this subcommand run `python FibMap.py calc -h` or `python FibMap.py calc --help`. 

#### Parameters

Any parameters given at the commandline will override their counterpart in this file. See **[Additional Help:](#additional-help) Input File Help** for more information. |
| `-c/--checkpoint_file filename ...` | None | Checkpoint file(s) to resume from last saved checkpoint(s). These checkpoint file(s) includes the original parameters for the run. Any commandline arguments that will effect the results of the run (e.g. trajectory_file, topology_file, n_protofilaments, omit_layers, etc.) will be ignored if a checkpoint file is provided. Cannot be set if `-i/--input_file` is. |
| `-f/--topology_file filename` | None | Topology file containing atom charges, bonds, and Segment IDs (e.g TPR). If no trajectory file is provided, the topology file must also contain coordinate information. The order of the segments is very important. See [MDAnalysis User Guide](https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/stable/formats/index.html) for valid file formats. *IMPORTANT: A specific segment ordering is required. See* **[Additional Help:](#additional-help) Topology File Setup** *below for details.* |
| `-f/--trajectory_file filename ...` | None | Trajectory file(s) containing coordinate information (e.g. XTC, TRR, PDB). If multiple are provided, the systems must match exactly.

predictable (proper ordering described below). If you did not originally set up your system in the described order you can try to reorder it
using MDAnalysis.

<div class="caption">
    Figure 7: An example fibril showing the proper order of segments in the topology. The fibril shown is an extended version of the human Serum Amyloid A (hSAA) fibril resolved by Cryo-EM ([PDB 6MST](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6MST)) by Liberta et al. [12].
</div>

The proper order should be layer by layer and protofilament by protofilament. For example, consider the fibril shown in Figure 7 with 12 layers and 2 protofilaments. Each segment is named with P[Protofilament #][Layer #] (e.g. the segment in layer 1 and protofilament 1 is P11, the segment in layer 1 and protofilament 2 is P21), the segment in layer 2 and protofilament 1 is P12, etc.).

The order of the segments in the topology file should be:
1. Layer 1, Protofilament 1 (P11)
2. Layer 1, Protofilament 2 (P21)
3. Layer 2, Protofilament 1 (P12)
4. Layer 2, Protofilament 2 (P22)
5. Layer 3, Protofilament 1 (P13)
6. Layer 3, Protofilament 2 (P23)
7. Layer 4, Protofilament 1 (P11)
8. Layer 4, Protofilament 2 (P21)
9. Layer 5, Protofilament 1 (P12)
10. Layer 5, Protofilament 2 (P22)
11. Layer 6, Protofilament 1 (P13)
12. Layer 6, Protofilament 2 (P23)
13. Layer 7, Protofilament 1 (P11)
14. Layer 7, Protofilament 2 (P21)
15. Layer 8, Protofilament 1 (P12)
16. Layer 8, Protofilament 2 (P22)
17. Layer 9, Protofilament 1 (P13)
18. Layer 9, Protofilament 2 (P23)
19. Layer 10, Protofilament 1 (P11)
20. Layer 10, Protofilament 2 (P21)

##### Input File Help

The parameters can be provided in an input file (specified with `-i/--input_file`) for the user's convenience. Only one parameter is allowed per line, separate the parameters name and the chosen value(s) with an equal-to sign (=). For flags (i.e. verbose, [no]saveraw, [no]log, [no]backup), set the value to either 'True' or 'False'. Lines may be commented out with a pound/hash/number sign (#). If a parameter can take multiple values (e.g. trajectory_file), you can either use separate entries for each value (e.g. put `trajectory_file = filename1`, `trajectory_file = filename2`, etc. on separate lines) or you can separate the filenames with a space in a single entry (e.g. `trajectory_file = filename1 filename2 ...`).

**Input File Template**

Here is a input file template for the `calc` subcommand to get you started:

```python

```

##### A Tip to Speed Up the Calculation

Depending on the length of your trajectory and the size of your system the calculation of hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and pi stacking interactions can take a long time. To speed this up, you can compute each
interaction type separately. Also, note that the calculation of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges can be parallelized, but the calculation of
pi stacking interactions can only be completed on a single processor (because the pi stacking calculation is relatively fast). These separate
calculations can be run using `--calctype` and `--nprocs`.

### map

After the intermolecular forces have been computed with the `calc` subcommand, the `map` subcommand can be used to create the fibril map. Run this subcommand with `python FibMap.py map ...`. For additional help with this subcommand run `python FibMap.py map -h` or `python FibMap.py map --help`. 

> *NOTE: This subcommand can only be run after the `calc` subcommand has completed.*

#### Parameters

##### Input

| Argument | Default | Description |
|--- |--- |--- |
| `-c/--checkpoint_file filename ...` | None | Checkpoint file(s) from finished calc job or previous map job. |
| `-i/--input_file filename` | None | Input file containing parameters for mapping job. All required commandline arguments and additional formatting parameters can alternatively be specified in this file. Arguments given at the commandline will override any of their counterparts given in this file. See **[Additional Help:](#additional-help-1) Input File Help & Additional Parameters** below for a list of parameters that can be set in this file.|

##### Output

| Argument | Default | Description |
|--- |--- |--- |
| `-o/--figure_file filename` | [output_directory]/fibmap.png | Path to and name of output image file. Can be any filetype that can be written by matplotlib. If using default, [output_directory] is the output directory specified for the previous calc run. |
| `--[no]log` | nolog | If log, save standard output to a log file. This option is better than manually passing stdout to a file at the commandline, as it will not write progress bars to the file. |
| `--[no]backup` | backup | If backup, past logfiles and past figure file images will be backed up. |
| `--showfig` | False | If used, the figure image will be opened after it is saved. |

##### Options

| Argument | Default | Description |
|--- |--- |--- |
| `--p_cutoff float` (0 $$\leq$$ float $$\leq$$ 1) | 0.5 | Probability cutoff for hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and pi stacking interactions. If the probability of a given interaction is less than this value then it will not be displayed on the map. (TIP: To hide all interactions, set this value to 1 and do not set `--hbond_n_cutoff`, `--hbond_p_cutoff`, `--saltbridge_p_cutoff`, or `--pistacking_p_cutoff`). |
| `--hbond_p_cutoff float` (0 $$\leq$$ float $$\leq$$ 1) | None | Individually set the probability cutoff for hydrogen bonds. If not set, p_cutoff will be used. (TIP: To hide all hydrogen bonds, set this value to 1 and do not set `--hbond_n_cutoff`). |
| `--hbond_n_cutoff float` (float $$\geq$$ 0) | None | If set, the average number of hydrogen bonds per frame formed between two groups will be used to determine whether or not a hydrogen bond is shown on the figure instead of a probability cutoff. If the average number of hydrogen bonds per frame is less than this cutoff then the hydrogen bond will not be displayed on the map. |
| `--saltbridge_p_cutoff float` (0 $$\leq$$ float $$\leq$$ 1) | None | Individually set the probability cutoff for salt bridges. If not set, p_cutoff will be used. (TIP: To hide all salt bridges, set this value to 1). |
| `--pistacking_p_cutoff float` (0 $$\leq$$ float $$\leq$$ 1) | None | Individually set the probability cutoff for pi stacking interactions. If not set, p_cutoff will be used. (TIP: To hide all pi stacking interactions, set this value to 1). |
| `--[no]legend` | legend | If legend, a legend will be included in the figure. |

```

##### Specifying Shaded Regions

On the map, hydrophobic zippers and water channels can be highlighted. These regions can be specified in the input file with the `zipper_region` and `water_region` options.  Individual shaded regions are identified by following a path along the residues that  define their borders.

To define the path:
Enter a series of sides separated by commas (,). Each side must contain a protofilament number (one-based) and a pair of residue numbers (using the resids from your topology). The protofilament number should be separated from the residue numbers by a colon (:) and the residue numbers should be separated from one another by a hyphen (-):
```
[Protofilament Number]:[Residue 1 Number]-[Residue 2 Number]
```
From the path, a polygon will be defined to go from residue to residue within each side and from the last residue of a side to the first residue of the next side. As such, the first residue in each side should be the one closest to the last residue in the previous side. 

> IMPORTANT: There cannot be any white space (e.g. spaces, tabs, etc.) in the path specification string. 
> 
> TIP 1: Only one side is necessary so you can specify a region encapsulated by a U-bend. 
> 
> TIP 2: If you want a region to contact a part of the side only at one residue you can list that residue twice in a side (e.g. 1:4,4)

**Example A**

A hydrophobic zipper between residues 1 to 32 on protofilament 1 and residues 1 to 32 on protofilament 2.

To add this region to the visualization add the following line to your input file: 
```
zipper_region = 1:1-32,2:32-1
```
**Example B**

</div>

To add these region to the visualization you can define them within your map input file by adding the following lines: 
```
water_region = 1:22-50
water_region = 2:22-50
```
OR you can define them on the same line:
```
water_region = 1:22-50 2:22-50
```

##### Bypassing the checkpoint system

I implemented the checkpoint system to ensure that users do not use a different system for the `calc` step and the `map` step. It also makes it so that the system does not need to be redescribed when running the `map` step. Let's say, however, that you don't care about the intermolecular forces and you just want to make a nice graphic of a layer of your fibril. In that case, you can just create a dummy checkpoint file (it's just a text file with several key parameters defined). Here's a template:

```
trajectory_file = # The name of the trajectory file
topology_file = # The name of the topology file
output_directory = # The output directory path
n_protofilaments = # The number of protofilaments
omit_layers = # The number of layers to omit on each end of the fibril
```

> *NOTE: All of these parameters are described in [calc: Parameters](#parameters)*

Alternatively, you could perform the calculation step on a single frame PDB of your fibril (will only take a second), and then run `map` with `--p_cutoff 1.0`.

### traj

**This module is currently in development, so proceed with caution.**

Use this subcommand to analyze the trajectory from the calc subcommand (with --saveraw) and plot the number of each type of interaction per layer versus time. For additional help use: `FibMap.py traj -h` or `FibMap.py traj --help`.

> *NOTE: This subcommand can only be run after the `calc` subcommand with --saveraw has been completed.*

#### calc Output File Descriptions

| FileName | Description |
|--- |--- |
| **calc_[calctype].cpt** | A checkpoint file to pick up the calculation from where it last left off. This file is always created. In order to avoid clashes with other `calc` checkpoint files, the file is named using the calctype (e.g. if `--calctype all` then the file is named calc_ALL.cpt). This file should be fed into `map` using the `--checkpoint_file` argument. This file can also be fed back into `calc` using the `--checkpoint_file` argument to pick up where it left off. If a file with this name already exists in the output directory this file will be backed up unless the `--nobackup` flag is used. |
| **calc_[calctype].log** | A log file containing STDOUT. This file is created if the `--log` flag is used. In order to avoid clashes with other `calc` log files, the file is named using the calctype (e.g. if `--calctype all` then the file is named calc_ALL.log).

```

## Tutorials

All of the necessary files for the following two tutorials can be found in the tutorials subdirectory of this repo.

### Tutorial 1: Creating a FibMap from a PDB

**Step 1: Obtain the PDB and reformat it**
1. Obtain the PDB ([PDB 6MST](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6MST)) from the [RCSB PDB Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/), from the tutorials/tutorial1 subdirectory, or go directly to [CHARMM-GUI](https://www.charmm-gui.org/).
2. Go to the [CHARMM-GUI PDB Reader & Manipulator](https://www.charmm-gui.org/?doc=input/pdbreader). We want to convert the PDB to include charge information and to have atom and residue names matching the CHARMM36 forcefield so that we don't have to play around with the input parameters too much. Here, if you have the PDB, you can upload it with "PDB format: PDB". If you don't have the PDB, type "6MST" into the "Download PDB File:" box with "Download Source: RCSB". Leave the "Check/Correct PDB Format" box unchecked and then click "Next Step: Select Model/Chain".
3. Leave everything on this page as is. Click "Next Step: Manipulate PDB".
4. Under "Terminal Group Patching" change the "Last" patch for each segment to "CNEU", then click "Next Step: Generate PDB".
   > *NOTE: If you're trying to do this for some other fibril, you should consider your terminal patches carefully. If there are not any missing residues, you should probably leave them as is. If there are missing residues and you leave them charged it might impact the salt bridge results.*
5. Download and unzip the results:
   ```
   mkdir charmm-gui && tar -zxvf charmm-gui.tgz -C charmm-gui --strip-components 1
   ```
   > *NOTE: The folder that is unpacked from charmm-gui.tgz typically has the JOB ID in the name (charmm-gui-[JOB ID]/). For the sake of this tutorial, the above command will automatically rename the folder "charmm-gui". If you want to keep the JOB ID in the folder name you can simply use `tar -zxvf charmm-gui.tgz`.*
6. Use correct_pdb.py in the helper_programs subdirectory to reorder the topology:
   > *NOTE: This program is somewhat crude, but should work for most systems. If not, you can use it as a guide for using MDAnalysis to reorder a topology file. For additional help, check out [this page](https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/stable/examples/constructing_universe.html) of the MDAnalysis user guide.*
   >
   > *NOTE: This may not be necessary for every fibril. Open the pdb outputted by CHARMM-GUI in VMD or some other molecular visualization program and make sure that the segments in the PDB appear in the correct order (See **[Usage: calc: Additional Help:](#additional-help) Topology File Setup** for more information).*

   - Feed step1_pdbreader.pdb and step1_pdbreader.psf to correct_pdb.py. These files can be found among the output of CHARMM-GUI.
      ```
      python correct_pdb.py -i charmm-gui/step1_pdbreader.pdb -c charmm-gui/step1_pdbreader.psf -o prepared --makefig
      ```
   - A figure will open showing the positions of each segment from three perspectives. Use this figure to determine the proper order of the segments. Write these down, or open the figure manually: it was saved to prepared_segment_locs.png.
    
<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/fibmap/prepared_segment_locs.png" title="Segment Locations Tutorial 1" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
</div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Figure 11: Segment location figure from correct_pdb.py for tutorial 1.
</div>
  
   - Follow the instructions outputted by the program. You should end up entering the following lines and then hitting [Enter] again:
      ```
      PROA PROC PROD PROL PROH PROJ
      PROB PROE PROF PROG PROI PROK
      ```

**Step 2: Run FibMap**
1. Run the calc step of FibMap using calc_input.inp:
   ```
   python FibMap.py calc -i calc_input.inp
   ```
2. Run the map step of FibMap using map_input.inp:
   ```
   python FibMap.py map -i map_input.inp
   ```

**The result should look like this:**

<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/fibmap/Tutorial1_FibMap.png" title="Result Tutorial 1" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
</div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Figure 12: Output for Tutorial 1.
</div>

### Tutorial 2: Creating a FibMap from an MD Trajectory

**Step 1: Reorder your topology and then run your simulation**

> *NOTE: This is not a tutorial on running an MD simulation, because such tutorials have been written by many others (personally, I recommend [Justin Lemkul's GROMACS tutorials](http://www.mdtutorials.com/gmx/index.html) as a starting point). I recommend, however, that you reorder the segments in your topology **before** running your simulations, as it is much more difficult to do after you have the trajectory. The helper program, correct_pdb.py (found in the helper_programs subdirectory), can help you do this, but it will not work for a trajectory.*

A sample trajectory with its topology file is provided in the tutorials/tutorial2 subdirectory. You will use top.tpr as the topology file (it contains all of the necessary information) and traj.xtc as your trajectory file for FibMap. I've also included top.gro in case you want to view the trajectory in [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/). This is a simulation of a 12 layer hSAA fibril derived from PDB 6MST. Note that this trajectory only contains 101 frames and as such will likely not produce a publishable result. For your own system, you should use many more frames from more than one trajectory.

**Step 2: Run FibMap**
1. Run the calc step of FibMap using calc_input.inp:
   ```
   python FibMap.py calc -i calc_input.inp
   ```
2. Run the map step of FibMap using map_input.inp:
   ```
   python FibMap.py map -i map_input.inp
   ```

**The result should look like this:**

<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/fibmap/Tutorial2_FibMap.png" title="Result Tutorial 2" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
</div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Figure 13: Map output for Tutorial 2.
</div>

1. Run the traj step of FibMap using traj_input.inp
   ```
   python FibMap.py traj -i traj_input.inp
   ```
    **The result should look like this:**

<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/fibmap/Tutorial2_Traj.png" title="Trajectory Result Tutorial 2" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
</div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Figure 14: Trajectory analysis output for Tutorial 2. The figure shows the number of each type of interaction per layer for each frame.
</div>
