  abstract={Cholesterol has been conjectured to be a modulator of the amyloid cascade, the mechanism that produces the amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) peptides implicated in the onset of Alzheimer's disease. We propose that cholesterol impacts the genesis of A$\beta$ not through direct interaction with proteins in the bilayer, but indirectly by inducing the liquid-ordered phase and accompanying liquid–liquid phase separations, which partition proteins in the amyloid cascade to different lipid domains and ultimately to different endocytotic pathways. We explore the full process of A$\beta$ genesis in the context of liquid-ordered phases induced by cholesterol, including protein partitioning into lipid domains, mechanisms of endocytosis experienced by lipid domains and secretases, and pH-controlled activation of amyloid precursor protein secretases in specific endocytotic environments. Outstanding questions on the essential role of cholesterol in the amyloid cascade are identified for future studies.},

  abstract={The $\beta$-secretase, BACE1, and the $\alpha$-secretase, ADAM10, are known to competitively cleave amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the amyloid cascades of Alzheimer’s disease. Cleavage of APP by BACE1 produces a 99-residue C-terminal peptide (APP-C99) that is subsequently cleaved by $\gamma$-secretase to form amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) protein, whereas cleavage of APP by ADAM10 is nonamyloidogenic. It has been speculated that ADAM10/APP and BACE1/APP interactions are regulated by colocalization within and outside of liquid-ordered membrane domains; however, the mechanism of this regulation and the character of the proteins’ transmembrane domains are not well understood. In this work, we have developed and characterized minimal congener sequences for the transmembrane domains of ADAM10 and BACE1 using a multiscale modeling approach combining both temperature replica exchange and conventional molecular dynamics simulations based on the coarse-grained Martini2.2 and all-atom CHARMM36 force fields. Our results show that membrane composition impacts the character of the transmembrane domains of BACE1 and ADAM10, adding credence to the speculation that membrane domains are involved in the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease.}
