    BACE1 (yellow) and ADAM10 (green) competitively cleave APP (blue) along the amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic pathways of the amyloid cascade of Alzheimer's Disease, respectively. One of the focuses of my research, is to understand the impact of membrane phase separation on the regulation of these proteins.

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Straub Group of Boston University's Department of Chemistry. In my current research, I am exploring the biochemistry and biophysics of amyloid fibril formation through the use of multiscale modelling. 

This site will be used for the dissemination of materials on topics ranging from basic principles of computational and theoretical chemistry to advanced concepts for simulation analysis.
